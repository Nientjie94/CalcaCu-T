# CalcaCu-T
This project is a simple calculator app built using HTML, CSS, Bootstap and JavaScript. 
The app allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
The user can input two numbers, select an operation, and calculate the result. 
There is also a reset button to clear the input fields and start over.
